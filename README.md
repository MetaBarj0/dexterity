# dexterity

An EVM compatible decentralized exchange working with ERC20 tokens.

## Layout

It's a mono repo.
Contains :

- The frontend (raw, unfinished)
- The backend (some read contract endpoints)
- The protocol (some desirable feature of a DEX, not finished, super clean and
  super  tested too though).

## More docs

Take a look in each project of the repo.
